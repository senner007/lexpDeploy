<h3><strong>The subject is who or what does the verb.</strong></h3>

		<p><strong><ins>The complete subject</ins></strong> of a sentence has all the words that tell who or what the sentence is about.<br />
		<ins>Examples:</ins></p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Everyone in my house</strong> is keeping a secret.</li>
			<li><strong>The old wooden chair</strong> broke underneath him.</li>
		</ul>

		<p><ins><strong>The simple subject</strong></ins> is the main word or words in the complete subject.<br />
		<ins>Examples:</ins></p>

		<ul>
			<li>The old wooden<strong> chair</strong> broke underneath him.</li>
			<li>The old<strong> radio</strong>, that had been quiet for a while, suddenly gave out a disturbing message</li> 
			<li>Around the houses were several hostile <strong>indians</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>*Sometimes the complete subject and the simple subject are the same.<br />
		<ins>Examples:</ins></p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Jake</strong> practiced and daydreamed for months before the game.</li>
			<li>Where am<strong> I</strong>?</li>
			<li><strong>Who</strong> phoned John?</li>
			<li>Who did <strong>John</strong> phone?</li>
			<li>There was <strong>nothing</strong> so Very remarkable in that;&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>A compound subject</strong> contains two or more subjects that have the same verb(s). The simple subjects in a compound subject are usually joined by and or or.<br />
