Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a _little_ way off, and she swam nearer to see what it was: she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

"Would it be of any use, now," thought Alice, "to speak to this mouse? Everything is so _out-of-the-way_ down here that I should think very likely it can talk; at any rate, there's no harm in trying." So she began, "O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very _tired_ of swimming about here, O Mouse!" The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing.

"Perhaps it doesn't understand English," thought Alice. "I dare say it's a _French_ mouse, come over with William the Conqueror." So she began again: "Où est ma chatte?" which was the _first_ sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright. "Oh, I beg your pardon!" cried Alice hastily, _afraid_ that she had hurt the _poor_ animal's feelings. "I quite forgot you didn't like cats."

"Not like cats!" cried the Mouse in a _shrill, passionate_ voice. "Would you like cats, if you were me?"

"Well, perhaps not," said Alice in a _soothing_ tone; "don't be _angry_ about it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah. I think you'd take a fancy to cats, if you could only see her. She is such a _dear, quiet_ thing." The Mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended. "We won't talk about her any more, if you'd rather not."

"We, indeed!" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of its tail. "As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always hated cats—_nasty, low, vulgar_ things! Don't let me hear the name again!"

"I won't indeed!" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. "Are you—are you fond—of—of dogs? There is such a _nice little_ dog near our house, I should like to show you! It kills all the rats and—oh, dear!" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone. "I'm afraid I've offended it again!" For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

So she called softly after it, "Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats, or dogs either, if you don't like them!" When the Mouse heard this, it turned 'round and swam slowly back to her; its face was quite _pale_, and it said, in a _low, trembling_ voice, "Let us get to the shore and then I'll tell you my history and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs."

It was _high_ time to go, for the pool was getting quite _crowded_ with the birds and animals that had fallen into it; there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and _several_ other _curious_ creatures. Alice led the way and the _whole_ party swam to the shore.
