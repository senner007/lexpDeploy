On the same day on which the treaty of peace was signed with Mexico (February 2, 1848), _gold_ was discovered in _California_.

Captain Sutter, a Swiss pioneer living near the site of the city of Sacramento — at Sutter’s Fort — was having a water-power sawmill built up the _river_ at some distance from his home. One day one of the workmen, while walking along the mill-race, discovered some bright yellow particles, the largest of which were about the size of grains of wheat. On testing them, Captain Sutter found that they were gold.

He tried to keep the discovery a secret, but it was impossible to prevent the news from spreading. “Gold! Gold! Gold!” seemed to ring through the air. From all the neighboring country men started in a mad _rush_ for the gold-fields. Houses were left half built, fields half ploughed. “To the diggings!” was the watchword. From the mountains to the coast, from San Francisco to Los Angeles, settlements were abandoned. Even vessels that came into the _harbor_ of San Francisco were deserted by their crews, sailors and captains alike being wild in their desire to dig for gold.

Within four months of the first discovery four thousand men were living in the neighborhood of Sacramento. The sudden coming together of so many people made it difficult to get _supplies_, and they rose in value. Tools of many kinds sold for large prices. Pickaxes, crowbars, and spades cost from ten dollars to fifty dollars apiece. Bowls, trays, _dishes_, and even warming-pans were eagerly sought, because they could be used in washing gold.

It was late in the year before people in the East learned of the _discovery_, for news still _travelled_ slowly. But when it arrived, men of every class—farmers, mechanics, lawyers, doctors, and even ministers—started _West_.

The _journey_ might be made in three ways. One was by sailing-vessels around Cape Horn. This route took from five to seven months. Another way was to sail from some Eastern port to the Isthmus of Panama, and crossing this, to take ship to San Francisco. The third route was overland, from what is now St. Joseph, Missouri, and required three or four months. This could not be taken until spring, and some who were unwilling to wait started at once by the water-routes.

Men were so _eager_ to go that often several joined together to buy an outfit of oxen, mules, wagons, and provisions. They made the journey in covered _wagons_ called “prairie-schooners,” while their goods followed in peddlers’ carts. It often happened that out on the plains they missed their way, for there was no travelled road, and a compass was as necessary as if they had been on the ocean.

Journeying thus by day, and camping by night, they suffered many hardships while on the way. Disease laid hold of them. Four thousand died from _cholera_ during the first year, and many more for lack of suitable food. In some cases they had to kill and eat their mules, and at times they lived on rattlesnakes. The scattered bones of men and beasts marked the trail; for in the frantic _desire_ to reach the _diggings_ the wayfarers would not always stop to bury their dead.

When the gold region was reached, tents, wigwams, bark huts, and brush arbors served as shelter. The men did their own cooking, washing, and mending, and food rose to famine prices. A woman or a child was a rare sight in all that eager crowd, for men in their haste had left their families behind.

It was a time of great _excitement_. The gold craze of ‘49 is a never-to-be-forgotten event in American history. As the search for nuggets and gold-dust became less fruitful, many of the men turned homeward, some _wealthier_ and some—alas!—having lost all they _possessed_.
