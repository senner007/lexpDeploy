The territory that now constitutes _England_, a country within _the United Kingdom_, was inhabited by ancient humans _800,000 years ago_. Continuous human habitation dates to around 12,000 years ago, at the end of the last _glacial period_. In the _Iron Age_, England was inhabited by the _Celtic_ people known as the _Britons_. In _AD 43_ the _Roman_ conquest of Britain began; the Romans maintained control of their province of Britannia through to the _5th century_.
The end of Roman rule in Britain enabled the _Anglo-Saxon_ settlement of Britain, which is often seen as the beginning of England and the English people. The Anglo-Saxons, a collection of various _Germanic_ peoples, established several kingdoms that became the primary powers in what is now England and parts of southern _Scotland_. They introduced the Old English language, which displaced the previous British language. The Anglo-Saxons made war with the _Celts_, whom they drove into Wales, as well as with each other. 
Raids by the _Vikings_ were frequent after about _AD 800_, and the Norsemen took control of large parts of what is now England. 
During this period several rulers tried to unite the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, an effort that led to the emergence of the Kingdom of England by the 10th century.
In _1066_, the _Normans_ invaded and conquered England. The Norman Dynasty established by _William the Conquerer_ ruled England for over half a century. The French invasion had a major influence on the language.
