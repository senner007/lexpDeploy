We were fifty-three days at sea, driven once so far to the southward by a severe storm, which struck us the second day out, as to sight the north coast of Africa before we were able to resume our westward course. To those of us who were _tightly_ shut into those miserable quarters below these facts came only as floating rumors, yet the intense suffering involved was all real _enough_. For forty-two hours we were battened down in darkness, flung _desperately_ about by every mad plunge of the vessel, stifled by poisoned air and noxious odors, and all that time without a particle of food. If I suffered _less_ than some others it was _simply_ because I was more accustomed to the sea. I was not nauseated by the motion, nor _unduly_ frightened by the wild pitching of the brig. Lying _quietly_ in my berth, braced to prevent being thrown out, amid a darkness so intense as to seem a weight, every sound from the deck above, every lift of the vessel, brought to my mind a sea message, convincing me of two thingsâ€”that the Romping Betsy was a staunch craft, and _well_ handled. Terrific as the gale became I _only_ grew more confident that she would _safely_ weather it.

Yet God knows it was horrible enough even to lie there and listen, to feel the hurling plunges downward, the dizzy upsweeping of the hull; to hear the cries, groans and prayers of frightened men, unseen and helpless in the darkness, the creaking timbers, the resounding blows of the waves against the sides, the horrid retching of the sick, the snarling, angry voices as the struggling mass was flung back and forth, the curses hurled _madly_ into the darkness. They were no longer men, but infuriated brutes, so steeped in agony and fear as to have lost all human instincts. They snarled and snapped like so many beasts, their voices unrecognizable, the stronger treading the weaker to the deck. I could not see, I could only hear, yet I lay there, staring _blindly_ about, conscious of every horror, and so weak and unnerved as to tremble like a child.
