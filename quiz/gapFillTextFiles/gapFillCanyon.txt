is the name of a painting by Norman Rockwell. In it we see an Indian family, a dog and a horse _on_ top of a canyon, _at_ the bottom of which, a river which has been blocked by a dam. Two eagles can be seen in the sky _above_ it.

The predominant colours are yellow, red and brown that are seen on the rocks and on the Indians' clothes. The river and sky are blue and so is the boy's shirt. The colors white and grey are seen on the concrete wall of the dam and on the dog and the horse.


The main focus is the Indian family which includes a man, a woman and a child. _In_ the foreground, the man, who is wearing a red shirt, is standing on what appears to be a platform _above_ the river, _next_ to the edge of the canyon. The boy is standing _beside_ him and the dog is _behind_ him. The woman is sitting _on_ a horse _to_ the right.


The man and the boy are looking at the dam _in_ the middle ground while the dog is looking down at the river _below_. The woman's gaze seems to travel _beyond_ all this, _towards_ the horizon and the eagles _in_ the background.


The dam is in the _middle_, _between_ the mountains in the background and the family in the foreground. The eagles, flying _towards_ the right, are positioned in the top left hand corner of the painting.
