As she _said_ this, she _looked_ down at her hands and _was_ surprised to see that she _had put_ on one of the Rabbit's little white kid-gloves while she _was talking_. "How can I _have done_ that?" she _thought_. "I must _be growing_ small again." She _got_ up and _went_ to the table to measure herself by it and _found_ that she was now about two feet high and _was going on  shrinking_ rapidly. She soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she _was holding_ and she _dropped_ it hastily, just in time to save herself from shrinking away altogether.

"That was a narrow escape!" said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence. "And now for the garden!" And she _ran_ with all speed back to the little door; but, alas! the little door was shut again and the little golden key _was lying_ on the glass table as before. "Things _are_ worse than ever," thought the poor child, "for I never was so small as this before, never!"

As she said these words, her foot _slipped_, and in another moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt-water. Her first idea was that she _had somehow fallen_ into the sea. However, she soon _made_ out that she was in the pool of tears which she _had wept_ when she was nine feet high.
