The painting shows a woman presenting a _robust_ turkey to _various_ generations of her family. She is the matriarch of the family serving the _main_ entree to her children and grandchildren while wearing an apron in Rockwell's _idealistic_ presentation of _family_ values. The patriarch of the family looks on with fondness and approval from the head of the table. In addition to the turkey arriving the table has a bowl of fruit, what appears to be cranberry sauce, celery and pickles. However, the servings are less _prominent_ than the presentation of _white_ linen, white plates and _water-filled_ glasses. The people in the painting are not actually eating because the painting depicts a lot of emptiness, especially their plates. In the background we see _billowing_ curtains. In addition there is a _covered silver serving_ dish that would traditionally hold potatoes. The table is the _central_ element of the painting. Its _creased_ tablecloth shows that this is a _special_ occasion for "sharing what we have with those we love". From the light gleaming through the windows, we can deduce that the painting depicts a _mid-afternoon_ meal.
