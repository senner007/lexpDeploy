Domestic dogs inherited behaviors from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack _hunters_ with complex body _language_. Their trainability, playfulness, and _ability_ to fit into human households and _social_ situations have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most _successful_ species on the planet today.
Human interaction played a significant role in shaping the subspecies. Domestication may have occurred initially in separate areas, particularly Siberia and Europe. Currently it is thought that domestication of our current lineage of dog began sometime around 15,000 years ago. Shortly after the latest domestication, dogs became ubiquitous in human populations, and spread throughout the world.
_Wolves_, and their dog descendants, would have benefitted from living in human campsâ€”more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to _breed_. Humans' upright gait gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as color vision that gives _humans_ better visual discrimination. Camp dogs would also have benefitted from human tool use, as in bringing down larger _prey_ and controlling fire.
Humans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps. For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by _cleaning_ up food scraps. Dogs may have provided _warmth_, and they would have _alerted_ the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute _hearing_ to give an early _warning_.
Anthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' _sensitive_ sense of smell to assist with the hunt. The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the _hunt_ is often mentioned as a primary reason for the _domestication_ of the wolf.
The cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human _groups_, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.
