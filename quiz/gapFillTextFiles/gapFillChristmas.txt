Christmas (meaning "Christ's Mass") is an _annual_ remembrance of the birth of Jesus Christ on December 25 and is a _holiday_ widely celebrated by millions of people around the world. It closes the _Advent_ season and initiates the twelve days of Christmastide, which ends after the _twelfth_ night. Christmas is a civil holiday in many of the world's nations and is _celebrated_ by an increasing number of non-Christians.
While the birth year of Jesus is thought to have been between 7 and 2 BC, the exact month and day are unknown. His _birth_ is mentioned in two of the four canonical _gospels_. By the early-to-mid 4th century, the Western Christian _Church_ had placed Christmas on _December_ 25. 
The _customs_ associated in various countries with Christmas have a mix of pre-Christian, Christian, and secular themes and origins. Popular modern customs of the holiday include gift _giving_, Christmas music and caroling, an exchange of Christmas cards, church celebrations, a special meal, and the display of various Christmas _decorations_, including Christmas trees, Christmas _lights_, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, _mistletoe_, and holly. 
In addition, several closely related and often identical _figures_, known as Santa Claus, Father Christmas, Saint Nicholas, and Christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to _children_ during the Christmas season. Because gift-giving and many other aspects of the Christmas festival involve heightened _economic_ activity, the holiday has become a _significant_ event and a key sales period for _retailers_ and businesses. The economic side of _Christmas_ is a factor that has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.
