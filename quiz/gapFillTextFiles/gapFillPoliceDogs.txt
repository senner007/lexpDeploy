United States Of America[edit]

Police dogs are often referred to as "K-9"(Canine) units. They are operated on the federal, state, county, and local level and are utilized for a wide variety of duties. Although most Americans see these animals as attack dogs, their duties generally include drug, bomb, and weapon detection and cadaver searches. The most common police dogs used for everyday duties are German Shepherds, though other breeds may be used to perform specific tasks.
On the federal level, police dogs are rarely seen by the general public, though they may be viewed in some airports assisting Transportation Security Administration officials search for explosives and weapons or by Customs and Border Protection searching for concealed narcotics and people. Some dogs may also be used by such agencies as the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Marshals Service.
Most police agencies in the United States - whether state, county, or local - use K-9s as a means of law enforcement. Often, even the smallest of departments operates a K-9 team of at least one dog, while the officers of more metropolitan cities can be more used to working with dozens. K-9s are not often seen by the public, though specialized police vehicles used for carrying dogs may be seen from time to time.
In most states, a police dog is considered a full-fledged police officer, sometimes even given a badge. As such, most laws find assaulting a police dog to be equal or very similar to assaulting a human officer, and as a result some agencies find it acceptable for officers to open fire on a person who is intentionally hurting a police dog, with apparent attempt to kill it.
Police dogs also play a major role in American jails and prisons. Special dog teams are used for breaking up large-scale fights or riots by inmates. Dogs - usually bloodhounds - also assist when searching for escaped prisoners.
