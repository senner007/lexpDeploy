Curiouser and curiouser!" cried _Alice_ (she was so much surprised that for the _moment_ she quite forgot how to speak good _English_). "Now I'm opening out like the largest _telescope_ that ever was! Good-by, _feet_! Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your _shoes and stockings_ for you now, dears? I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you."

Just at this moment her _head_ struck against the _roof_ of the _hall_; in fact, she was now rather more than nine _feet_ high, and she at once took up the little golden _key_ and hurried off to the garden _door_.


Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one _side_, to look through into the _garden_ with one _eye_; but to get through was more hopeless than ever. She sat down and began to cry again.

She went on shedding gallons of _tears_, until there was a large _pool_ all 'round her and reaching half down the _hall_.

After a time, she heard a little _pattering of feet_ in the _distance_ and she hastily dried her _eyes_ to see what was coming. It was the White _Rabbit_ returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white _kid-gloves_ in one _hand_ and a large _fan_ in the other. He came trotting along in a great _hurry_, muttering to himself, "Oh! the _Duchess_, the Duchess! Oh! won't she be savage if I've kept her waiting!"


When the Rabbit came near her, Alice began, in a low, timid voice, "If you please, sir" The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid-gloves and the fan and skurried away into the _darkness_ as hard as he could go.

Alice took up the fan and gloves and she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking. "Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day! And yesterday _things_ went on just as usual. Was I the same when I got up this _morning_? But if I'm not the same, the next _question_ is, 'Who in the world am I?' Ah, that's the great _puzzle_!"
